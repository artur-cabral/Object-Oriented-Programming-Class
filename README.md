# Object-Oriented-Programming-Class
This repository contains a series of codes from labs, and projects from one of my classes on object-oriented programming, usin C++ as the programming language.

<h2>3DTTT</h2> 
<p>The first project developed for this class was a 3D Tic-Tac-Toe. The idea of this game consists on the game of Tic-Tac-Toe but structured in a cube, which there are outter and inner faces of the cube, and the cabe can be played and won in any dimension of the cube. In other words, the game is similar to the original one, however, it can be won horizontally, vertically, and diagonally in any dimension of the cube, giving some dificulty to the game, and more possibilities of plays.<br>
In the folder you can find the code for the board, and how it is structured, for the players, and for the initial code of a computer player. The computer player can never be compared to an AI attempt, but it was a way found to make a 1 player game at the time of the project.

<h2>Project 2 - 5 card stud Game</h2>
<p>
  The second project developed for this class have the intention to simulate a 5 card stud game. The goal is to get the best hand of cards possible from the dealer to win the hand, and consequentially, the game. In this scenario, the players do not have much autonomy in the game, but it is an option still to be developed if necessary.

  <h2>Project 3 </h2>
  <p>
  The goal of this project was to develop a board for the game still to be developed for the final project. The map here created should be in a shape to be integrated with future code from other students.<br>
  The map should contain all the rooms, and possibilities of entry and exit for the player to interact.
   </p>

<h2>Final Project</h2>
<p>
  The main objective for the final project was to combine all the knowledge acquired from the course and apply it to a single program or application. It was decided by the group that a text-based adventure game was going to be created. Text-based adventure games interact with the player all through text, describing the situation the player is in, and gives all the options the player can choose from, and possible moves to make.<br>
  This one is a medieval themed text adventure game, and the goal for the player is to go from the beginning to the end of the map without losing all of its lives, and collect the holy weapon to kill the big enemy in order to win the game. There are some rooms or places the player has to go through, some items that need to be taken, but it is all up to the player. The game is self-explanatory once you start playing.
