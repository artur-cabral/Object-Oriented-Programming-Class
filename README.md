# Object-Oriented-Programming-Class
This repository contains a series of codes from labs, and projects from one of my classes on object-oriented programming, usin C++ as the programming language.

<h2>3DTTT</h2> 
<p>The first project developed for this class was a 3D Tic-Tac-Toe. The idea of this game consists on the game of Tic-Tac-Toe but structured in a cube, which there are outter and inner faces of the cube, and the cabe can be played and won in any dimension of the cube. In other words, the game is similar to the original one, however, it can be won horizontally, vertically, and diagonally in any dimension of the cube, giving some dificulty to the game, and more possibilities of plays.<br>
In the folder you can find the code for the board, and how it is structured, for the players, and for the initial code of a computer player. The computer player can never be compared to an AI attempt, but it was a way found to make a 1 player game at the time of the project.

<h2>Project 2 - 5 card stud Game</h2>
<p>
  The second project developed for this class have the intention to simulate a 5 card stud game. The goal is to get the best hand of cards possible from the dealer to win the hand, and consequentially, the game. In this scenario, the players do not have much autonomy in the game, but it is an option still to be developed if necessary.

  <h2>Project 3 </h2>
  <p>
  The goal of this project was to develop a board for the game still to be developed for the final project. The map here created should be in a shape to be integrated with future code from other students.<br>
  The map should contain all the rooms, and possibilities of entry and exit for the player to interact.
